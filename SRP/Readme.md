# Single Responsability Principle (SRP)

The single responsability principle (SRP) states that a class, module, or function should have only one
reason to change, meaning it should focus on a single, well-defined task or actor.

### Key Aspects of the Single Responsibility Principle:

- **One Reason to Chnage** : A module should only be responsible to one, and only one, actor or stakeholder.

- **Separation of Concerns** : Unrelated functionalities should be separated into different classes or modules.

- **Key Benefits** :
  - **Eager Testing**: Smaller, focused classes are simpler to test.
  - **Reduced Complexity**: Easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Improved Flexibility**: Looser coupling makes the system more robust to changes.
